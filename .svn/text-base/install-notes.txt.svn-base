Be aware of:
- conf/Catalina/localhost/appform.xml
- postgres-xxxxxxx.jar, which should be in /lib dir in a exclusive way
- servlets must be configured properly in web.xml
- hibernate.xml has to have the proper database server
- take care of log4j system
- also take care of database permissions, sometimes a table can not be written as
the permissions are not correct for the user gcomesana:appform (us:pw)
- MIND THE ENABLED FOR TRIGGERS WHEN THE DATABASE IS IMPORTED VIA DUMP SCRIPT!!
