- interview performance, user access and interview management audit in database 
(applog table) and file (by using log4j and auditing to 
$CATALINA_HOME/logs/appform directory)

- simultaneous (concurrent) access not allowed for any user (one user can be logged in
just once at the same time)

- now a new interview has its own datatypes from the scratch (basic types will 
be cloned for the new interview)

- the admin user is able to see any interview template along with modifying and
deleting them. Not able to create new interview templates (as they need an owner)

- Session listener (org.cnio.appform.audit.AppSessionListener) appears to work 
fine now.
- Programatic group management finished. Features are:
	- as before, there are two sort of groups: primary (country, company) and 
	secondary (department, lab, office, ...)
	- New active group concept, for both primary and secondary groups
	- For an user with several primary groups, primary group selector (modal 
	dialog) is early displayed to choose the active primary group
	- At the time to perform an interview, the user should be choose one among
	his/her many secondary groups

by sending every answer at a time or by using the traditional method.
- Audit issues solved.
